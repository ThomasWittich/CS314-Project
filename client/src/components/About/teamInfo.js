While I am studying at CSU, I actually grew up in California, and while I was in high school I picked up an interest in coding through writing text-based video games. In my free time, I like to do sprite design and sew.",

I mostly got into coding because of my father and his influence on my life. I fostered this interest throughout high school. I was fortunate enough to have a wide selection of STEM classes at my high school and we were located by ACC. Because of this I was able to achieve a certificate in CISCO networking and now I am looking forward to learning even more in college.",
